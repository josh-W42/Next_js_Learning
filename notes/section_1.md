# Notes From Section 1:

## Benefits of Using Next.js

1. It allows you to build full stack applications with just React.js.

- Blends front-end and back-end into the same project.
- Improved Server Side Rendering (SSR) -> Improved SEO -> Improved Reach
  - This can be observed when you view the source of a next.js app and compare that the source of a react.js app. We can actually see the HTML content in the next.js app, and thus SEO crawlers.
- Route Setup and handling. File-based Routing (As opposed to using React Router)
  - To create a new route, create a new folder within the app directory and create a "page.js/ts".
- Form Submission.
- Data Fetching.
- Authentication.
- And MORE.
